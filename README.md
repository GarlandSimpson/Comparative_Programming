<ul>
<li> asg1 = Scheme </li>
  Scheme is a dynamically typed (mostly) functional language with a very simple syntax.
In this assignment, you will write a Silly Basic language interpreter in
Scheme. The interpreter will read in an intermediate language program, parse it,
and then interpret it. No looping constructs may be used, so it is critical that certain
parts use proper tail-recursion to avoid nuking the function call stack.
<li> asg2 = Ocaml </li>
<li> asg3 = Smalltalk </li>
<li> asg4 = prolog </li>
</ul>
