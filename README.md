# Comparative_Programming
Lab Submissions from Comparative Programming course @ UCSC - Winter 2018
<ul>
<li> asg1 = Scheme </li>
  Scheme is a dynamically typed (mostly) functional language with a very simple syntax.
In this assignment, you will write a Silly Basic language interpreter in
Scheme. The interpreter will read in an intermediate language program, parse it,
and then interpret it. No looping constructs may be used, so it is critical that certain
parts use proper tail-recursion to avoid nuking the function call stack.
<li> asg2 = Ocaml </li>
  In this assignment, you will implement a desk calculator in Ocaml, a language with
strong static type checking. Your program will be a strict subset of dc(1), although it
will not have all of its functions. Begin by reading the man page for dc(1) and experimenting
with it. Study its input format, output format, error messages, and exit
status.
<li> asg3 = Smalltalk </li>
  Smalltalk is a pure object-oriented language, where everything is an object, and all
actions are accomplished by sending messages, even for what in other languages
would be control structures. In this project we will be using Gnu Smalltalk, the
Smalltalk for those who can type [http://smalltalk.gnu.org/].
<li> asg4 = prolog </li>
  You will use Prolog to write an airline reservation system for the Twilight Zone Airlines.
Given a request to travel from one city to another, print out the flight
schedule. For each leg of the trip, print out the departure airport, airport, city
name, and time.
